        "description": "Handmade rainbow glitter sparkle studs. Square Wood post earrings made from a fallen tree branch.  Studs are topped with a coat of resin to create a glass like finish.  Posts are surgical steel, so are fine for sensitive ears.\n\nThese unique studs are made from the smallest storm damaged fallen tree branches, I don&#39;t like to let even the smallest branches go to waste. My family and I go on hikes in the woods and haul back arm loads of branches! I get my chop saw out, safety goggles on and start cutting! Each piece is sanded down smooth , created and sealed with a coat of resin to give a glass like finish. \nI have a passion for re-purposing and doing my part for our enviroment. I love to create out of found objects, so the two go hand in hand. \n\n\nThis a is a unique gift for that girl who loves nature.  Eco-friendly and beautiful.  \n\n\n*****No tree were harmed in the process of making my jewelry- all wood comes from storm damaged trees :) \n\nEarring are 1\/2 inch square.",
